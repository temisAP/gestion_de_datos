abstract = {The Cubesat radiometer radio frequency interference technology validation mission (CubeRRT) was developed to demonstrate real-time onboard detection and filtering of radio frequency interference (RFI) for wide bandwidth microwave radiometers. CubeRRT's key technology is its radiometer digital backend (RDB) that is capable of measuring an instantaneous bandwidth of 1 GHz and of filtering the input signal into an estimated total power with and without RFI contributions. CubeRRT's onboard RFI processing capability dramatically reduces the volume of data that must be downlinked to the ground and eliminates the need for ground-based RFI processing. RFI detection is performed by resolving the input bandwidth into 128 frequency subchannels, with the kurtosis of each subchannel and the variations in power across frequency used to detect nonthermal contributions. RFI filtering is performed by removing corrupted frequency subchannels prior to the computation of the total channel power. The 1 GHz bandwidth input signals processed by the RDB are obtained from the payload's antenna (ANT) and radiometer front end (RFE) subsystems that are capable of tuning across RF center frequencies from 6 to 40 GHz. The CubeRRT payload was installed into a 6U spacecraft bus provided by Blue Canyon Technologies that provides spacecraft power, communications, data management, and navigation functions. The design, development, integration and test, and on-orbit operations of CubeRRT are described in this article. The spacecraft was delivered on March 22nd, 2018 for launch to the International Space Station (ISS) on May 21st, 2018. Since its deployment from the ISS on July 13th, 2018, the CubeRRT RDB has completed more than 5000 h of operation successfully, validating its robustness as an RFI processor. Although CubeRRT's RFE subsystem ceased operating on September 8th, 2018, causing the RDB input thereafter to consist only of internally generated noise, CubeRRT's key RDB technology continues to operate without issue and has demonstrated its capabilities as a valuable subsystem for future radiometry missions.},

abstract = {CubeSats are positioned to play a key role in Earth Science, wherein multiple copies of the same RADAR instrument are launched in desirable formations, allowing for the measurement of atmospheric processes over a short evolutionary timescale. To achieve this goal, such CubeSats require a high-gain antenna (HGA) that fits in a highly constrained volume. This paper presents a novel mesh deployable Ka-band antenna design that folds in a 1.5 U (10× 10 × 15 cm3) stowage volume suitable for 6 U (10× 20 × 30 cm3) class CubeSats. Considering all aspects of the deployable mesh reflector antenna including the feed, detailed simulations and measurements show that 42.6-dBi gain and 52% aperture efficiency is achievable at 35.75 GHz. The mechanical deployment mechanism and associated challenges are also described, as they are critical components of a deployable CubeSat antenna. Both solid and mesh prototype antennas have been developed and measurement results show excellent agreement with simulations.},

abstract = {A very significant challenge in planetary missions' design and operations is communications with ground control teams during critical events and highly risky maneuvers. These events include entry, descent, and landing (EDL) and orbit insertion, which should not be carried out in the blind – without at least downlink communications. Although vast planetary distances and long round-trip light times disallow real-time intervention from controllers, acquiring the relevant performance parameters in near realtime can be imperative for determining the corrective actions needed immediately following the critical event or, in the case of significant anomalies, aid in the diagnostic efforts. During several previous Mars missions landing events, and the Huygens probe landing on Titan, the communications strategy relied on proximity links to planetary orbiters, which then relayed the data to the Deep Space Network (DSN). A second back-up and parallel method was the successful attempts to receive the signal carrier directly at Earth, often using large radio telescopes when the wavelength was outside the DSN's reception bands. This Direct-to-Earth (DTE) method was only possible due to special techniques utilizing the DSN's open-loop receivers. In every case, picking up the signal during EDL was very challenging since the lander's link budget was designed for proximity relay via a local orbiter and not for distances across the solar system. Not all future missions can rely on the presence of preexisting orbiters at their planetary targets to relay their critical data and, furthermore, most missions would not likely have the resources to implement a reliable DTE link at acceptable data rates. A new method is introduced here that increases the chances of communications success. With the advent CubeSats, one or more of them can be launched with the primary mission, travel to the planetary target, be positioned to view the critical event, and carry out real-time relay of the data to the DSN at acceptale rates. CubeSats have flown in the Earth environment but not in deep space, so careful design as well as flight experience are needed. The relay function requires the possible development of new radios and antennas to meet challenging specifications due to the low mass, size, and power. After an initial technical demonstration of the concept and gaining operational experience, the cost can decrease as systems become more standardized and the reliability increases. This paper describes the invention of the “carry your own relay” concept and the formulation of a mission likely to be the first planetary CubeSat mission called Mars Cube One (MarCO). It also describes the operational concept of relay via small spacecraft and their significant role in reducing mission risk as well as overall mission cost.},
